# svg-widget-toolkit

Starter repository for creating widgets using SVG.js
For the text box, you can only edit the text while in the hover state.
For the scroll bar, I chose to not support scroll when your mouse is not over the widget. While most scroll bars allow you to move the thumb even while not pressing over the widget, some scroll bars still work like the one I implemented.
For my custom widget, I chose to make toggle button instead of my originally planned spinner widget.
